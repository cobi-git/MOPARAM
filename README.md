## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multi-omics datasets are becoming increasingly complex, making it difficult to extract meaningful relationships between different biological features. In this paper, we propose a general guideline for multi-omics data analysis based on nine crucial factors, including sample size, feature selection, preprocessing type, noise ratio, sample balance, number of groups, cancer subtype combination, omics combination, and clinical features. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed guidelines by conducting benchmark tests on various types of TCGA cancer datasets using ten clustering-based multi-omics methods. Our results demonstrate that our proposed guidelines can significantly enhance the accuracy of multi-omics analysis, especially when it comes to feature selection, sample balance, and noise reduction. Overall, this paper provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, helping them to better navigate the challenges of multi-omics data analysis and extract meaningful relationships between different biological features.


## Getting start <a name="getting-start"></a>

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
The following link is the data used in this study.

TCGA DATA: http://cobi.knu.ac.kr/tools/moparam/TCGA_DATA.tar.gz

### Recommended system spec <a name="recomended-spec"></a>

Basically, the functions provided by the MOParam project are mainly data generation, preprocessing, and benchmarking tests, which operate in a parallel processing manner to handle large-scale data. To complete a single test within a day, it is recommended to perform them on a server-class computer with around 100 cores and 300GB of memory.

### Data generation <a name="data-generation"></a>
To use data generated by oneself in addition to the 10 TCGA cancer datasets refined in this study, the following data should be needed:

1. Clinical data(Target label)
2. Omics data
